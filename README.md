# AdaptivePricingEngine
This project aims to develop a dynamic pricing strategy for various types of bookings (e.g., hotels, events, rentals) based on historical data. The main components of the project include data ingestion, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training and evaluation, and deploying a pricing engine with an API.
